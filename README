The Ackermann Function in Ada, c, Cobol, Fortran

---------------------Ada------------------------
program is done in both using recursion and iteration.

the iterative verison is called stack_ada.adb and uses external
functions from stack.adb which needs to be compiled before the main
program. compiled using gnatmake and is run by typing ./stack_ada

the recursive verion is called Recu_Ada.adb
It is compiled using gnatmake and takes user input 
and is run by entering ./Recu_Ada
---------------------C------------------------
program is done in both using recursion and iteration.

the iterative version is called stack_c.c 
compiled using gcc -ansi -wall stack_c
takes user input

the iterative version is called stack_c.c 
compiled using gcc -ansi -wall stack_c
---------------------Cobol------------------------

					NOTHING

---------------------Fortran------------------------
program is done using recursion

the recursive version of this is compiled with gfortran

the iterative version is incomplete
